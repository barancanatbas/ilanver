Please read the [announcement of the new Elasticsearch JavaScript client](https://www.elastic.co/blog/new-elasticsearch-javascript-client-released) or navigate to the [repository directly](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js).

We have built a [migration guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/breaking-changes.html) that will help you move to the new client quickly.
